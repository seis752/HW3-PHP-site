I estimate that I spent somewhere around 11-12 hours on this project. About 2-3 hrs were spent with setup issues related to Dreamhost, the database and 
the like. The rest was on programming/coding. I was able to write code for most of the funcitionality you asked for. But I did not have time to work on
sorting the messages by friends. I was struggling with how to develop that function. I was able to build code for most functions and items but ran out of
time to even test out any code. 

My biggest problem was simply the volume of items and features and the time it took to plan them out (design) as well as trying to code it. I did spend some time
thinking about the database structure and how best to set up the fields with each table. I could have used a different primary key such as friendname or username
for relationships instead of a relationshipid (integer). Jumping back and forth between SQL, PHP and HTML did slow me down somewhat making sure I didn't mix them
up or place the code in wrong location. And then I had separated a couple of functions out into separtate files including login.php and navbar.php which added 
to the number of files to manage. Handling mutiple queries and then setting up the logic to perform functions like remove and add friend took some time. I think
the handoff of data from the form to the database is always a bit challenging. The syntax trips me up fairly often when missing a needed bracket, semicolon or 
quotations.
