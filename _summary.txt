* The PHP/MYSQL stack was by far very frustrating without using a framework. 
Identifying the database model wasnâ€™t difficult but extracting the data from the 
tables in a clean data structure and displaying them without violating software engineering principles was.

The biggest issue for me was the PHP language being syntactically inconveniant and hard to read in comparison to other C 
based languages. The cost to development time was far greater than expected as setting up the MAMP/WAMP server
required prior experience on my part otherwise it would have been tedious. The apache server does not serve files
directly without placing them in the correct location which isn't apparent immediately. The speed of rapid development between
UI, database and services made it difficult to accomplish all the tasks.

The benefit however is that PHP gives developers the ability to start backend dev work immediately with the ```<?php``` keyword


HW6:

The changes in HW6 are assuming that twilio messages are stored in their own table `twilio` but displayed in the same view.
