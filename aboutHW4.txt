Summary of HW 4

Despite all my next comments about the struggles, I really liked the assignment and how much I have learnt from it.
I wish we had more guidance with the setup of all the blocks needed to work on this project.
What I have managed to do: get the user to login, if not logged in - register. Login and remain logged in until logout is chosen.
Once user is logged in, he gets redirected to profile page, where he sees his messages. User can navigate to All users and Friends.
I was not able to finish the post message, and add user is not working properly.
gitignore is "hiding" the db-const.php file
